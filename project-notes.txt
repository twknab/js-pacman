# GENERAL NOTES

################

Always do a CSS reset so that all browers handle it the same.

Start by designing out the HTML and CSS first, and add the javascript after.

Work on one function at a time and get it right.

Add another function, once you've got one figured out.

Don't get frustrated, sometimes it may take weeks or months to see your result.

Be resourceful, use developer forums and tools online to facilitate your learning and to ask questions to larger communities, whom might be able to give you insight.
