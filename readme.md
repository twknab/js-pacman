# About

This is a rendition of PacMan using only HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.

Note: This project draws only one level, one ghost, and allows for control of the Pacman, while also creating coins and fruits. Collision detection is also built in when the ghost is contacted, but the ghost does not move, nor does the game automatically refresh (you must refresh manually) when a collision occurs. There are many ways to improve this simple concept into a fully functioning game.
